# Weather-API

**Version 1.5**

* Practiced API calls with a Weather App
* This App allows you to search for the weather in different cities
* It will give you a 5 day forcast and also include temp, wind conditions, humitity, and UV index
* Previous searches will be saved in local storage and presented on the left hand side
* A alert will prompt you if you do not enter a valid city name
* An api key was required for the Open Weather One Call API so a personal account was created
